> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The total time taken to complete the Travel_Tracker_2 task was between 8-10 hours. This time was distributed to tasks in this manner:
  - Class_Creation (1.5-2 hours)
  - Class_Testing (0.5 hours)
  - Kivy_Creation (2-2.5 hours)
  - Travel_Tracker_2 Creation (1-1.5 hours)
  - Travel_Tracker_2 Testing and Error Checking (3-3.5 hours)
It can be easily observed that Testing and Error Checking took a large amount of time to complete, this can be due to the large number of minor changes that were made into the task; such as simple print statements. This is supplied further evidence due to the comparatively miniscule time to test and error check multiple classes.
