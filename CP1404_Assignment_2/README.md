# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Tristan Harrington

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The total time taken to complete the Travel_Tracker_2 task was between 8-10 hours. This time was distributed to tasks in this manner:
  - Class_Creation (1.5-2 hours) __(Updated)__
  - Class_Testing (0.5 hours)
  - Kivy_Creation (2-2.5 hours) __(Updated)__
  - Travel_Tracker_2 Creation (1-1.5 hours)
  - Travel_Tracker_2 Testing and Error Checking (3-3.5 hours)

It can be easily observed that Testing and Error Checking took a large amount of time to complete, this can be due to the large number of minor changes that were made into the 
task; such as simple print statements. This is supplied further evidence due to the comparatively miniscule time to test and error check multiple classes.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
During the development stage of this app, it was discovered that a large number of code from the original Travel_Tracker could be reused and repurposed. This allowed for time to be focused in other directions of development. Streamlining the process of creating large components such as saving/loading data and sorting lists of class objects.

It is also noted that the __getitem__ function proved increasingly useful for calling attributes from place into placeCollection. This allowed the code to directly call attributes like the visited/priority value and define them directly which was critical in the sorting method found within the placeCollection class.   

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
During the coding stage, it was exceptionally aggrivating to use __Github__ as it became difficult to commit and push data to the correct locations. This problem eventually spiraled and caused a major data loss, to both the kivy_GUI/Installation and class codes. Whilst rewriting the code proved far easier in the next iteration, (shown with the updated status) it was still a major problem that could not be solved due to the issue of recursive data loss.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Whilst creating the initial backbone for the code, it was extremely simple to utilize the kivy language. Creating __Spinners__ and __BoxLayouts__ proved to be simplistic in nature but offered a variety of choices and adjustments further helping initial development. Whilst it was assumed that this major part would prove difficult due to a lack of similarity, it was surprisingly easy to navigate and research if needed.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
The most vital part of code in this project that could be improved would certainly entail the sorting algorithm
